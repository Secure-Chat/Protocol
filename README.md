# Tick Talk Protocol
### Current Protocol Version: v2.0.0-beta
------------------------------------------
**Created by Gregory Conrad in April 2018**

Tick Talk is a fully open source communication platform that aims to provide anyone with any device a secure way to communicate.

Features that sets Tick Talk apart:
* We use a renowned open source encryption library (libsodium) which has been trusted by many popular applications
* Tick Talk ensures full encryption when talking to others in a group chat and in private messaging
* Many modern features desired by users are already implemented, and the list is only growing! See below to give us more feature ideas
* Anyone paranoid (or not) can run their own Tick Talk server if they so choose. This ensures their data's security
