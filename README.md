Tick Talk is a fully open source communication platform that aims to provide anyone with any device a secure way to communicate.

Features that sets Tick Talk apart:
* We use a renowned open source encryption library (libsodium) which has been tested by many experts
* Tick Talk ensures full encryption when talking to others in a group chat and in private messaging
* Many modern features desired by users are already implemented, and the list is only growing!
* Anyone paranoid or not can run their own server if they so choose
* Come up with other selling points
