# FOR USE IN THE FUTURE

# Connecting to the server
In order to send and receive messages, a client must first connect to at least one chatroom.

# Connecting to a chat room
`{ "type":"connect", "room":"ROOM_GOES_HERE", "name":"NAME_GOES_HERE" }`

# Server sending unencrypted errors / messages to clients
`{ "type":"server-message", "room":"ROOM_GOES_HERE", "msg":"MESSAGE_GOES_HERE" }`

# Messages
`{ "type":"message", "room":"ROOM_GOES_HERE", "timestamp":"TIME_STAMP", "name":"NAME_GOES_HERE", "msg":"MESSAGE_GOES_HERE" }`
- Servers should send an error back if the nickname is already taken
- TODO timestamp description (milliseconds thing) (is a string for int compatibility)
- Messages should be destroyed one week after the client sends
- For messages from client to server, timestamp and name should be null (server will process both)

# Requesting messages
`{ "type":"request", "room":"ROOM_GOES_HERE", "min":"START_TIME", "max":"STOP_TIME" }`
- Servers should reply with any messages within the specified range, inclusive
- Times will be strings representing miliseconds elapsed
